### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
-  Upvote and downvote comments
-  **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
-  **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Built with

-  VUE JS
-  VUEX (state management)
-  TAILWIND CSS
